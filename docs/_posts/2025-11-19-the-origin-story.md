On November 19th 2025, this all started with a prompt:

> "So I've got a weird idea that scratches a horrible itch a lot of my friends have. We used to share our lives and private thoughts in close circles in an app called Path. I loved the closeness and intimacy of the app. It shut down a few years ago, I'm not sure why. I want to develop this app again. As a web app first, with modern technology (caching and stuff) and ideally on top of the technological backend where mastodon runs on. The big no for mastodon was the technical background, but I'd like to abstract that away. Sign up should be easy and effortless, creating private groups too. Emphasis should be on feeling like "coming home", interacting with friends and keeping things private and close to chest. Give me a bit of history please for path to help me design and define a vision, let's think of a business model / cost structure, and a broad technical feasibility on top of mastodon and a modern front end."

This is for now the place this project flourishes, or perhaps dies as just another idea.
