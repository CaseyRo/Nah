# Nah Reflections

Building in public means sharing not just the code, but the thinking behind it.

These reflections document the decisions, trade-offs, and lessons learned while building Nah — a private social network for your closest 150 people.

## What is Nah?

**Nah** ("Not Alone Here") is a private social network inspired by Path. Our core beliefs:

- **Small by design** — 150 friends max (Dunbar's number)
- **Private by default** — no public timelines, no algorithmic feeds
- **Open source** — community-funded, transparent, yours to verify
- **Viral? Nah. Vital.** — we optimize for connection, not engagement
