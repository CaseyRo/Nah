# Nah

**A private home for your closest people.**

> *"Share with your circle, not the world."*

Nah ("Not Alone Here") is a private social network limited to **150 friends** — inspired by [Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(social_network)), built on modern open-source infrastructure, and designed to never compromise on intimacy.

## Core Principles

- **Small by design** — 150 friends max (Dunbar's number)
- **Private by default** — no public timelines, no algorithmic feeds
- **Real friends, real moments** — mutual friendships, rich moment sharing
- **No algorithmic theater** — chronological feed only, no engagement optimization
- **Open source** — community-funded, transparent, yours to verify

## The Manifesto

* Small by design.
* Private by default.
* Real friends, real moments.
* No algorithmic theater.
* **Viral? Nah. Vital.**
